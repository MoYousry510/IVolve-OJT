## Create an OC PVC to add presisting storage to the pods then a deployment with 1 replica using the NGINX image. Exec into the NGINX pod and create a file at /usr/share/nginx/html/hello.txt with any content, verify the file is served by NGINX using curl localhost/hello.txt. Delete the NGINX pod and wait for the deployment to create a new pod then exec into the new pod and verify the file at /usr/share/nginx/html/hello.txt is present.
### First we create a pvc

### Then we create a deployment file linking our mount volume to the pvc

### We then apply deployment, exec into the pod and add our file

### Finally we delete the pod, wait for it to be recreated by the deployment, and then exec into it and check for file.
### As we can see the file presists
